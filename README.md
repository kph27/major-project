# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
A recent projection by the United Nations (UN) foresees that by 2050 nearly 70% of
global population will be living in the cities. This urbanization trend leads to
considerable demands for transportation, industrial production, infrastructure and
energy. This would raise concerns on sustainable development and require the
need for effective measures for environmental monitoring in urban areas.
Interdisciplinary and trans disciplinary efforts embracing advances in information
and communication technology (ICT), autonomous systems, data science,
computer science, systems theory, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and artificial
intelligence (AI) have formed the basis for smart sustainable city development.
Towards environmental sustainability and social resilience in metropolitan areas,
it is essential for residents to have clean air. In this regard, technical measures are
needed for monitoring and improving air quality, whereby IOT-enabled wireless
sensors networks are promising among available monitoring systems for healthy
built environment and air quality management.

# ABSTRACT:
This project is an Internet of Things-enabled low-cost wireless sensor network with
newly-developed dependable schemes to improve reliability for monitoring air quality
in suburban areas. The system features sensing units for router communications with
energy savings from dynamic conservation. Based on the reliability function and mean
time to failure, a continuous time Markov chain model is used to analyze the
monitoring performance. The proposed dependable monitoring network is shown to
achieve high availability with regards to energy consumption and data assurance with
the survival probability of over 80% during a minimum period of 72-hour operation for
monitoring air quality in a suburb. Distributions of fine particle concentrations studied
over a 6-month period demonstrate feasibility of the developed system in its high
correlations to benchmark monitoring stations with the Pearsonâ€™s coefficients obtained
at 0.903 and 0.817 respectively for PM2.5 and PM10.
