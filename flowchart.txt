1.importing the packages
2.exploring the dataset - Sensor FEature Data
3.data processing
	- Using Pandas Dataframe
4.visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Feature Selection and Splitting the data to train and test
6.building the model
	- Linear Regression
	- RAndom Forest
	- ElasticNet Model
	- Decision Tree
	- Voting Regression
    
7.training the model
8.building the model with Voting Regression since it gives better Score comparing with Other Models 
9.Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10.importing the packages
11.User gives input as Sensor Feature Values 
12.the given input is preprocessed for prediction
13.trained model is used for prediction
14.final outcome is displayed through frontend

Note:

Extension - Voting Regression, ElasticNet model is build as Extension for feature values
used for prediction since we it gives better accuracy around 80% comparing with other Models
